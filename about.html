                    <h3 id="what">What is sustainability?</h3>
                    <p>Sustainability means meeting our own needs without
                        compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
                        own needs. In addition to natural resources, we also need social
                        and economic resources. Sustainability is not just environmentalism. Embedded in most
                        definitions of sustainability we also find
                        concerns for social equity and economic development.</p>
                    <h3 id="why">Why especially Ocean?</h3>
                    <p>Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, found that the likelihood of disease
                        on coral reefs impacted by plastic pollution was significantly higher than
                        those that were plastic-free. More than 150 reefs across the Asia-Pacific
                        region were surveyed for signs of disease by examining the health of
                        more than 124,000 corals and recording the presence of plastic larger
                        than 0.5 centimeters. Diseases such as white syndrome and black band
                        disease were recorded, both of which have the potential to rapidly kill
                        corals (Reef-World, July 2, 2020)</p>
                    <p>Research suggests that 52% of the world’s turtles have eaten plastic
                        waste. The reasons are simple: a floating plastic bag can look like a lot of
                        jellyfish, algae, or other species that make up a large component of the
                        sea turtles’ diets.(Worldwildlife, n.d.) Of the 8 million tons of plastic pollution making its
                        way into our oceans
                        each year, only a small percentage of it is actually made up of plastic
                        straws. Turtles mistakenly identify them as food and eat them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Hundreds of sharks and rays are dying after getting tangled in drifting
                        “ghost nets” and plastic waste, according to new research. the
                        researchers found 74 entanglement reports involving 559 individual
                        sharks and rays from 26 species including whale sharks, great whites,
                        tiger sharks and basking sharks.

                    <h3 id="how">How we can improve?</h3>
                    <h4>Avoid single-use plastics</h4>
                    <p>Single-use plastics, such as plates and cutlery made from this material, make our lives easier,
                        but seriously harm the planet. These types of products have viable alternatives and there is an
                        urgent need to chose these.</p>
                    <h4>If you go shopping, remember to take a reusable bag</h4>
                    <p>We go to the supermarket at least once a week to fill up our fridges. If every time we go we use
                        reusable bags (cloth, string or wicker) the health of our planet will improve. From now on
                        remember to take yours when leaving the house.</p>
                    <h4>Replace plastic Tupperware for glass or steel container</h4>
                    <p>If you eat at work, a Tupperware container is part of your day. We suggest you change your
                        routine and opt for glass or stainless steel containers. Not only will the planet appreciate it,
                        so will your health because some of these plastic containers can release harmful substances.</p>
                    <h4>Recycling correctly</h4>
                    <p>Our lifestyle sometimes prevents us from paying attention to details. Therefore, when it comes to
                        recycling plastic waste it can end up in the wrong container. Before throwing your waste away,
                        think where each item has to go.</p>
                    <h4>Choose to reuse and give some of the packaging a new purpose</h4>
                    <p>If you have no choice but to buy a plastic bottle or a plastic container at the supermarket,
                        reuse it instead of throwing it away. A bottle can be filled up as many times as you like and
                        containers can be used to store other food.</p>
