                <p>
                    Since Oceeco is an environmental brand that mainly focuses on marine 
                    sustainability, our team decided to use various shades and tints of 
                    the colour blue for our logo. According to colour psychology, blue 
                    is the colour that creates calmness and serenity. It is often described 
                    as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly. Blue is also often seen as 
                    a sign of integrity, stability, and reliability. Moreover, the colour 
                    blue is strongly associated with the ocean and marine life, which is 
                    the topic that we are concentrating on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose the shape of a circle because circles are round and soft, 
                    which gives off a feeling of stability and collaboration. Circles 
                    are often associated with wholeness and unity, and they can also 
                    portray security, continuity, and protection. The shape is a single, 
                    continuous line without variation, creating harmony and representing 
                    the meaning behind commitment, love, and community. On the other hand, 
                    using asymmetrical logo design offers a growing brand like us a unique 
                    and subtle way to express our exciting personality.

                <img class="article__img" src="img/oceeco_gradientlogo.png" alt="Oceeco gradient logo"/>
            </div>

            <div class="box content2">
                <p>
                    Due to the fact that our target audience is children, we decided to 
                    create our logo mostly with natural and organic shapes, which are 
                    rounded and curvy. By applying these types of shapes to our logo, 
                    we make the overall logo look more comforting and approachable 
                    compared to sharp and arithmetical shapes. In addition, these curvy 
                    lines and shapes also draw children's attention with their free 
                    sense of movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of using flat graphics, we applied several gradient colours 
                    to our design in order to create the stereoscopic look and make the 
                    logo more appealing to look at. Since our project is mostly used for 
                    online purposes, gradients would be a great idea because it offers 
                    a memorable, creative and playful to our logo. Furthermore, we tried 
                    to keep the logo as minimalist as possible with simple shapes, symbols, 
                    and representations because we wanted it to be easy to understand to 
                    our target group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, using a combination of logotype and logomark creates a memorable 
                    visual of our brand for viewers. It offers flexibility for just the brand 
                    name or symbol only. We have flat and gradient versions to satisfy our brand's 
                    different usage needs, such as printing and online.
