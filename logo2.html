                    <h3>Custom Logo</h3>
                    <p>Since Oceeco is an environmental brand that mainly focuses on marine
                        sustainability, our team decided to use various shades and tints of the colour blue for our logo.
                        According to colour psychology, blue is the colour that creates calmness and serenity. It is often
                        described as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly. Blue is also often seen as a sign of
                        integrity,
                        stability, and reliability. Moreover, the colour blue is strongly associated with the ocean and
                        marine
                        life, which is the topic that we are concentrating on.</p>

                    <p>We chose the shape of a circle because circles are round and soft, which gives off a feeling of
                        stability and collaboration. Circles are often associated with wholeness and unity, and they can
                        also
                        portray security, continuity, and protection. The shape is a single, continuous line without
                        variation,
                        creating harmony and representing the meaning behind commitment, love, and community. On the other
                        hand,
                        using asymmetrical logo design offers a growing brand like us a unique and subtle way to express our
                        exciting personality.</p>

            <div class="container_image">
                <div class="logo_text">
                    <p>Due to the fact that our target audience is children, we decided to create our logo mostly with
                        natural and organic shapes, which are rounded and curvy. By applying these types of shapes to our
                        logo, we make the overall logo look more comforting and approachable compared to sharp and
                        arithmetical shapes. In addition, these curvy lines and shapes also draw children's attention with
                        their free sense of movement.</p>

                    <p>Instead of using flat graphics, we applied several gradient colours to our design in order to create
                        the stereoscopic look and make the logo more appealing to look at. Since our project is mostly used
                        for online purposes, gradients would be a great idea because it offers a memorable, creative and
                        playful to our logo. Furthermore, we tried to keep the logo as minimalist as possible with simple
                        shapes, symbols, and representations because we wanted it to be easy to understand to our target
                        group.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, using a combination of logotype and logomark creates a memorable visual of our brand for
                        viewers. It offers flexibility for just the brand name or symbol only. We have flat and gradient
                        versions to satisfy our brand's different usage needs, such as printing and online.</p>
